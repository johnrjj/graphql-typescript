#GraphQL Example (Query + Mutation w/ Relay edge/node compliance)

`yarn && tsc && node dist/index` to start. 

Navigate to graphiql like usual (http//localhost:3000/graphql)

Comments:
I really like GraphQL personally. We use it in production at my day job, and it's a real cool piece of technology. 
Using it with Relay however is like going into warp-speed DevX. Currently trying to figure out how to layer/combine this with serverless tech (aws lambda) elegantly.
